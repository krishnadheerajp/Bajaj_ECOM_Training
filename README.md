Hyatt Restaurant Management System is the final project which we developed during the end of our training as a team,
it uses Angular and Bootstrap in the frontend and the backend APIs are developed in Laravel along with MySQL database.
It uses proper MVC architecture. The user can order food, book a table, give feedbacks, see his cart and orders, payment integratinon is done using RazorPay API
which is in test mode. The admin can add new food items to the menu, update current items, see available items, read feedbacks, see the tables booked,

for validation purpose along with the backend validators.
